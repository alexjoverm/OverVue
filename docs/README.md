# OverVue.dev

OverVue.dev is a way to quickly grab pieces of code covering the core concepts of Vue.js. More info in [the about](/about) section. Let's start with some common CLI commands.

## What is OverVue.dev ?

I build this website (using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)) as I was starting my journey with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for two reasons:

- Learning the different parts of Vue.js
- Quickly find snippets covering basic concepts of Vue.js.

## What about the official Vue Doc ?

**The Official Vue doc is amazing**, people say it's arguably the best JS framework doc out there. Overvue.dev is just meant to cover quickly the core concept of Vue, it's an easy way for me to grab some snippets, so I figured I would share it with you. I linked the official doc on each page. I also organized it the way made sense to me. I welcome and encourage any feedback.
