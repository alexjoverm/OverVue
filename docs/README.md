# What is OverVue.dev ?

I build this website (using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)) as I was starting my journey with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for two reasons:

- Learning the different parts of Vue.js
- Quickly find `code snippets` covering basic concepts of Vue.js.

## About me

My Name is Romain Capelle. Born in the verdant prairies of Northern France, now based in the United States, I still inhale cheese and escargot. For more info, check out my [Personal Website](https://www.romaincapelle.com)

## Shoutouts

To my friend [Ted](https://bit.ly/2VQAtxp) for introducing me to Vue and getting me started with it.
I also wanted to thank Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller for [his amazing course on Vue and Vuex](https://acad.link/vuejs) that you can also find on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/). I would advise any newcomers to the world of vue.js to get a look at his tutorials. This website was built following along with his course.
