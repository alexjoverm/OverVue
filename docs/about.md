## What is OverVue.dev ?

I build this website (using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)) as I was starting my journey with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for two reasons:

- Learning the different parts of Vue.js
- Quickly find `code snippets` covering basic concepts of Vue.js.

## Shoutouts

To my friend [Ted](https://bit.ly/2VQAtxp) for introducing me to Vue and getting me started with it.
I also wanted to thank Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller for [his amazing course on Vue and Vuex](https://acad.link/vuejs) that you can also find on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/). I would advise any newcomers to the world of vue.js to get a look at his tutorials. This website was built following along with his course.

## What about the official Vue Doc

The Official Vue doc is amazing, people say it's arguably the best JS framework doc out there. Overvue.dev is just meant to cover **quickly** the core concept of Vue, it's an easy way to grab some hopefully usefull pieces of code. I linked the official doc on each page so that you can find more explanation on each subjects. I also organized it the way I understood made sence to me. I welcome and encourage any feedback.
