## Shoutouts

To my friend Ted for introducing me to Vue and getting me started with it.
I also wanted to thank Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller for [his amazing course on Vue and Vuex](https://acad.link/vuejs) that you can also find on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/). I would advise any newcomers to the world of vue.js to get a look at his tutorials. This website was built following along with his course.
